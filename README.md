# Flask CI/CD Lab

This is a simple Flask web application designed for practicing **AWS CI/CD deployment** using **CodePipeline**, **CodeDeploy**, and **EC2**. The app runs on Python 3.9 and serves a basic homepage.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

Flask-lab/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Flask app
â”œâ”€â”€ appspec.yml # AWS CodeDeploy config
â”œâ”€â”€ buildspec.yml # AWS CodeBuild instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh # Installs Python & Flask
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ start.sh # Starts Flask app on port 5000
â””â”€â”€ templates/

##  Deployment Workflow

1. **CodePipeline** pulls the code from GitHub.
2. **CodeBuild** runs `buildspec.yml` to prepare the app.
3. **CodeDeploy** uses `appspec.yml` to:
   - Run `scripts/install.sh` for dependencies.
   - Run `scripts/start.sh` to launch the Flask app.

##  Requirements on EC2 Instance

Before using CodeDeploy, make sure your EC2 instance:

- Is running **Ubuntu**
- Has the **CodeDeploy Agent** installed
- Is accessible via **IAM Role** with CodeDeploy and S3 permissions
